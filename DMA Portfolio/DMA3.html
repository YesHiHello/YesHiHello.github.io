<h3 style="color:white;">Artist Statement</h3>

  <p style="background-color:black; color:white" class="text-center";>Like any other fidgety kid in grade school, the only reason I picked up a pencil was because it was placed down in front of me and I didn't know what else to do with it. ADHD made my drawings very scattered and seemingly random. But my inspirations all came from the same place: cartoons. As I grew older, doodling my ideas suddenly became less of a pass time, and more of an experiment. I became obsessed with the goal of creating a monster, an environment, or an experience that would capture the eyes of like-minded dreamers and take them on a journey. Growing up in the early 2000’s, my generation witnessed the great speed at which technology was advancing, and before I could even do long division, I was familiar with screen tablets and digital art. Old enough to remember the floppy disks and VHS tapes of the 90’s, and young enough to hop onto Vine trends that dominated the Internet, digital media art is simply another element of my childhood that has continued to evolve. That intense evolution of technology was scary to some, but gave inspirations of the future for others like myself.</p>

 <p style="background-color:black; color:white" class="text-center"> With my work I aim to endear people with wholesome characters, enthralling stories, and horrifying themes. The contrast of friendly faces in a cold and unforgiving world is the reflection of the very earth we bumble around in everyday, all I'm doing is adding glitter. The early inspiration of anime and its themes of friendship are likely what sparked the idea of my comical, colorful characters. These characters raised me, they were my idols and inspirations when the real world proved to be unreliable. And with that sentiment in mind, it is only natural that the world becomes darker and less shiny as one grows older. People come and go, friend circles change, the world becomes more polluted, you’re introduced to the entire dumpster fire that is politics. The plastic box encasing my youth is ripped away and the toys inside are discarded. I have grown up, but my childhood characters have stayed the same, untouched by the grime and horror that occur in reality. And with the advent of technology like virtual reality, I aim to blur the line between childhood nostalgia and cruel reality.  </p>

<p style="background-color:black; color:white" class="text-center">I have grown up with digital art and to attempt any other kind of medium would be like changing faiths. To inspire another creative is a sweet victory that not only gives rise to new art but also goes on to create more inspiration. I want to inspire others, and in turn, be inspired by others. On another hand, most of my art is purely self-fulfilling. I create what my heart wants to see, when it wants to see it. And while I know that no two people are ever the same, there are simply basic elements of art that will always attract an audience, no matter whom you’re making it for. I want my art to reach someone the way that it has reached me; whether it is fear, nostalgia, sadness, or humor, any sincere reaction produced from my art is a success.  </p>
